The following list of chemicals were found in your wristband:


### List of Chemicals found
```{r  ListChemFoundNoClass, results='asis', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Pull out the results for our ONE SUBJECT
###  We doing as INNER cause we REQUIRE all internal data MUST map every tested chem to a classification


#Convert classificaiton col to character
# Do SQL call without doing SQL using native stuff
oneResultClassified<-inner_join(oneResult_with_Y_flag,class_L, by="ParameterID") %>% 
  select(ParameterName,CASNumber,classification) %>%
  group_by(ParameterName,CASNumber) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(Classifications=paste(classification,collapse=", ")) %>%
  arrange(ParameterName) %>%
  select(ParameterName,CASNumber)   
# This is silly to group with classification and THEN ungroup but doing it for uniform approach



names(oneResultClassified)<-c("Chemical Name", "CAS Number")


#THIS REPORT got TOO WIDE so was made to fit onto multiple pages and so the basic table point was LOST
# NOTE that "split.table= Inf" is the thing that makes this NEVER PAGE WRAP and so is good for HTML but not so good for WORD
pandoc.table(as.data.frame(oneResultClassified)
             ,caption="Report of Chemicals found on your Wristband"
             ,justify=c("left","left")
             ,emphasis.rownames=TRUE #RowNames never get emphasis... SHOULD switch to gt() someday
             ,split.table = Inf
             )
rm(oneResultClassified)
