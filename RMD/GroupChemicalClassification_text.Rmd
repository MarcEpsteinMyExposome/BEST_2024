## Chemical Groups: Number of Unique Chemicals Found

If we look at this data broken down by chemical groups we can also examine how many distinct chemical compounds of each classification were found across all the wristbands.  


```{r UniqueClassificationsFound , results='asis', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE }

#knitr::kable(ClassCompare[,2:ncol(ClassCompare)],format="markdown")
#FIRST change column names so Partcipant becomes the actual name of the subject
#names(ClassCompare)<-c("Classification",subject,"Average","Total Unique Chemicals")
#SET names of COLUMNS but use "Participant" for subject for NOW and change it SOON
#names(ClassCompare)<-c("classification",subject,"Average","Maximum Any Wristband")


##ClassCompare3<-ClassCompare %>%
#    mutate_if(is.factor, as.character) %>%   #Eliminate classification as a FACTOR so it sorts correctly
#    arrange(classification) %>%
#    select(classification,"Total Unique Across All Wristbands")

####NOTE NOTE NOTE the line below WAS what was here THEN i did the usatoday ONE ROW and somehow needed to change 2 to 1???
#pandoc.table(ClassCompare[,2:ncol(ClassCompare)],

#pandoc.table(ClassCompare3[,1:ncol(ClassCompare3)],
#              justify=c("left","center")
#              ,split.table = Inf)
             #justify=c("left","center","center","center"))
              #justify=c("left","center","center","center","center")

names(CountChemicalsInEachClassification)<-c("Classification","Unique Chemicals across all Wristbands")

# 
# pandoc.table(CountChemicalsInEachClassification,
#               justify=c("left","center")
#               ,split.table = Inf)

# Convert to gt table
CountChemicalsInEachClassification %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = md("**Chemical Classifications Across Wristbands**")) %>%
  cols_align(align = "left", columns = "Classification") %>%  # Left-align first column
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = "Unique Chemicals across all Wristbands") %>%  # Center-align second column
  tab_options(table.width = px(600))  # Keep table width fixed


```
