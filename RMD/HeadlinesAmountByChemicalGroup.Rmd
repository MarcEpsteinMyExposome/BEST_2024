<!-- PRINT Headline Rule for total chemical GROUP as denoted by Silent Spring using a separate RMD file-->

<!--  Headlines for amount detected (by chemical group)     
We propose applying these headlines to each chemical group separately. The participant would receive the top priority headline that applies for each chemical group. The headlines are not exhaustive (i.e., not all participants will necessarily receive a headline for every group). The headlines are intended to highlight particularly high or low.  

SubClassScores seemss to already have manny values.  It shows how any of each category each person has.  SO for each CLASS (i.e. "Chemicals in Commerce") 
BUT subclassscores doesn't have enough detail to do this

You had some {group name} detected in your wristband that were not found in most others.

NEED to add "classification" if it isn't already to the big result table.  THEN we can do anything w/ a query on that table.

THIS IS COMPLICATED and unclear what I really want to display... TBD.

```{r RunRcodeToFindClassificationMessages, results='asis', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.width=10, fig.height=4}

### Load the R code to fill in the value of report_messages

source(setRdirectory("HeadlinesAmountByChemicalGroup_R_Code.R"), 
       local = knitr::knit_global())


### HERE WE DEFINE testResults.bigWithClass and this gets done when this file is first SOURCED and then it is passed-in as value
testResults.bigWithClass  <- testResults.big %>%
  #filter(Result > 0) %>% # choose only hits
  left_join(class_L, by = "ParameterID",relationship = "many-to-many") %>% #this is many to many because many wristbands have same parameter ID and some ParameterIDs have multiple classifications
  select(ParameterID,ParameterName,SampleNumber,Result, classification)

# ADDING CLASSIFICATION to testResults.big BUT NOTE that this creates duplicate rows cause some parameterID have multiple class SO
#   ONLY use this when necessary to lookup CLASS
### NOTE NOPE NOTE:   I went back to base code, and made sure that EVERY data file, including DRS had one row for each unique combo of sampleNumber and ParameterID




## Call the function
#report_messages <- generate_report(subject, testResults.bigWithClass)
report_messages2 <- generate_report2(subject, testResults.bigWithClass, oneResult, classExplainTable, class_L)
#rm(testResults.bigWithClass)  I may use this later
