You have taken part in a MyExposome demonstration project to identify the chemicals detected in your environment while you wore a Silicone Wristband.  We are reporting about  **`r howManyChemicalsTested`** compounds.  Even though we carefully check each result, it's possible that you were exposed to a chemical we tested for but we don't report it because the amount was too small for us to detect.
