You have taken part in a MyExposome demonstration project to identify the chemical compounds 
which were detected in your environment
over a period of approximately one week.  We are using your wristband to report any detectable level of each of  **`r howManyChemicalsTested`** compounds.  

**`r testExplanation`**

All analysis was done "blind" to any aspect of the underlying study design with unique identifiers assigned to each wristband. Your unique participant identifier for the purposes of this analysis is:   **`r subject`**.
