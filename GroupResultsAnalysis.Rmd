# Group Comparison Results

As previously stated, the average number of chemicals found was **`r round(averageNumberChemsFound,1)`**. All wristbands were tested for **`r howManyChemicalsTested`** chemicals.


<!-- r subject<-NULL    -->




## Plot each Chemical of Concern {.tabset  .tabset-pills}

We checked all the chemicals anyone in this study was exposed to in databases that flag harmful chemicals. Just because a chemical is flagged doesn't mean the amount an individual was exposed to is harmful. Also, many chemicals haven't been tested for safety so not being in a database doesn't mean it's safe. The graph shows how much of a certain chemical was found in wristbands. The blue circle is the average amount, the green circle is the middle value. The wider light blue area represents how common different amounts are, with wider parts showing levels found in more people. Click each chemical name to see how exposures compares.

## Plot Remaining Chemicals {.tabset  .tabset-pills}


Besides the chemicals already mentioned, other chemicals were also found on wristbands in this study group. Many chemicals haven't been tested for safety so not being in a database doesn’t mean it’s safe, but it also doesn’t mean it’s harmful.  In fact, some of these compounds may occur naturally and even be beneficial at some levels. The graph shows how much of a certain chemical was found in wristbands. The blue circle is the average amount, the green circle is the middle value. The wider light blue area represents how common different amounts are, with wider parts showing levels found in more people. Click on each chemical name to compare your exposure to others in the study.

## Check against Databases

For all the chemicals found on ANY wristband during this project we will look that chemical up in various databases to show what various scientific organizations have determined regarding issues with those chemicals. Please note that unless we explicitly call it out we do not have information that determines any of the levels reported on these compounds are unsafe.

### Chemicals Found as % of Participants

Here are all the chemicals found on any wristband. If every participants wristband contained a given chemical that chemical will show height as 100%. If only one person had a chemical it will be the shortest possible bar. The dashed red line is drawn at 50% to more easily discern chemicals that were found in most of the samples.

`r if(DoSpecificSubjectAnalysis){"If the chemical was found on your wristband then that bar is colored blue.  If the chemical was found on at least one other participant, but not on your wristband, the bar is colored grey.  For example, if you see a high percentage of blue bars up near 100% then your sample has a high overlap with the rest of the study group.  If most of the blue bars are down below 50% then your sample does not overlap as much with the rest of the group."}`

### Chart of All Tested-for Chemicals

As a more detailed breakdown, we can get an overview of the test for all the chemicals found in every tested wristband. The chart below has a horizontal line for every tested chemical. The blank space shows that most of the chemicals don't show up in any of the tested wristbands in this participant sample but, once a chemical is found in one of the wristbands it is typically found in others as well. This can be seen below by observing how frequently the horizontal light-blue lines are aligned. The diagram after this one provides more details about the specific chemicals found, the purpose of this diagram is to show an overview.

### Chart of all Found Chemicals

To allow us to look more carefully at the blue lines, we'll eliminate from the chart all those lines which represent chemicals found in none of the wristbands in this sample set. We'll also eliminate any of the wristbands that didn't have ANY chemicals found. The chart below has a horizontal line for every tested chemical that was seen in at least one wristband.

`r if(DoSpecificSubjectAnalysis){"Your wristband is differentiated by color."}`

```{r GroupactiveChemChart, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=12,fig.cap=""}

# r_long_tmp[ (r_long_tmp$value>0)  , ]$value <- 1   # This will set all results >=1 to be one
# #Set all the values of r_long that have Y FLAG to be ONE so that I can later change the color...

### Heat Map: "relatively how much" of each chemical

The following chart shows how your wristband compares to each other wristband in this group in terms of how many, and how much, of each chemical was found. We eliminate from the chart all those lines which represent chemicals found in none of the wristbands in this sample set showing only chemicals that at least one person did show in his/her wristband.

`r if(DoSpecificSubjectAnalysis){"Your wristband name is highlighted in green on the bottom row of the chart."}`

NOTE: It is important to understand this chart properly. A darker red color means MORE of the chemical compound was found while a lighter color means relatively less was found. A white, or blank, means that none of that compound was detected in your wristband. Having said that, please do not try to compare BETWEEN ROWS. Mathematically speaking the colors have no meaning when compared between rows due to different rates of uptake of each chemical into a wristband. In other words, just compare the colors across a given row, not between rows.

To create this chart, we normalized within each row based on the maximum value for that chemical in any wristband. We then separate the values into 5 groups and color coding all items within each group. It is useful to remember that the groups are relative to each row separately and independently. The five groups are:

-   Top 25%
-   3rd 25%
-   2nd 25%
-   Bottom 25%
-   None Found

In the image below the black squares highlight which wristband had the maximum value for each chemical. `r if(DoSpecificSubjectAnalysis){"The green dots indicate your wristband."}`

`r if(nrow(testResults.big[testResults.big[, "Flag"] == "Y", ])>0){"Any wristbands where we detected a chemical, but could not quantify it, are suppressed from this chart below."}`

### Nanograms of any Chemicals

Each tested wristband picked up different amounts of different chemicals. One simple question is "how much total chemical compound, of any type, did each wristband, or each nanogram-of-wristband, pick up? In other words, if we tested for a list of chemicals, and Wristband-A picked up 10 nanograms of Chemical 1, and 10 nanograms of chemical 2 and none of the other chemicals, then Wristband-A picked up a total of 20 nanograms of chemicals. The exact number is not as interesting as is the SIZE OF THE NUMBER relative to other people who wore the wristband and were tested for the same chemical.

#### Matrix showing Quartiles

The matrix below shows the result of normalizing the values found, based on the maximum value found, and then breaking up the values into 4 quartiles while leaving those with no-value-found at zero. In other words, we process each row so that it has only the values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

```{r  decide_if_skip_printing_big_matrix, results='asis', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
tooManyBandsToPrintMatrix <- 100
tooManyCHemicalsFoundToPrintMatrix <-75
if (howManyUniqueChemFoundAcrossAllWristbands < tooManyCHemicalsFoundToPrintMatrix && howManyWristbandsTested < tooManyBandsToPrintMatrix){
  allow_matrix_to_print<-TRUE
} else {
  allow_matrix_to_print<-FALSE
}

```

```{r print_skip_printing_matrix_message, results="asis" , echo=FALSE, eval =  (!allow_matrix_to_print)}

cat("**Please see separately provided files for large matrix data sets which would normally be displayed here.  Since your project had a large results table, it is easier to view on its own rather than in this file** ",sep="")

```

```{r  x5_pandoc_q, results='asis', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=allow_matrix_to_print}

# NOTE that split.table=inf makes sure we never split table and it is as wide as data
# could have used:  
#   panderOptions('table.split.table', 300)
# which I think says ... allow 300 columns

#


## Grab the parts of testResults I want to print which is 
#     chemical name, wristband name (sampleNumber), and what quartile
#     use replace_na to Get rid of all the NA values and replace with quartile of ZERO

### NOTE that I filtered to get rid of Result>0 below BUT if a WB had NO compounds then
#     it didn't show in matrix at ALL which seemed wrong SO...
#     commenting this out and replacing w/ version without filter.
#     HOPEFULLY this doesn't cause other problems?
# quant_data<-testResults.big %>% filter(Result>0) %>%
#   select(ParameterName,SampleNumber,quartile) %>%
#   spread(SampleNumber,quartile) %>%
#   replace(is.na(.), 0) %>%
#   arrange(ParameterName) %>%
#   rename('Chemical Name'=ParameterName) %>%
#   as.data.frame()

### 2/21/2019  NEW VERSION without FILTER
# quant_data<-testResults.big  %>%
#   select(ParameterName,SampleNumber,quartile) %>%
#   distinct() %>%   #When i got rid of FILTER for zero on 2/21 I introduced duplicates maybe this fixes.  Fixed 2/24/2019

#   replace(is.na(.), 0) %>%    
#   arrange(ParameterName) %>%
#   dplyr::rename('Chemical Name'=ParameterName) %>%
#   as.data.frame()

## BUT UNFORTUNATELY (11/12/2021) NOW i get a weird "NOT FOUND" value in the rows so THAT didn't work... Try to get rid of that not-found and see if that helps....

#### Matrix showing Raw Values

In this next matrix (below), you see the same data but it is not mean centered nor broken into quartiles.

```{r print_loreal_4b, results="asis",  echo=FALSE, eval=wristbands_week_and_weight_adjusted}

cat("More exactly, it is the raw nanograms found in each gram of wristband material ",
      "normalized to time-adjust the values as though the wristband were worn for exactly one week. ",
      sep=" ")

```

```{r print_loreal_4b_2, results="asis",  echo=FALSE, eval=wristbands_time_adjusted_one_week_not_weight}

cat("More exactly, it is the raw nanograms found in each gram of wristband material ",
      "normalized to time-adjust the values as though the wristband were worn for exactly one week. ",
      sep=" ")

```

```{r print_DRS_detection_limit, results="asis" , echo=FALSE, eval =RMD_type == "DRS"}

cat("The median value for detection limits across all compounds ",
      "is approximately 200 ng/Wristband or 50ng/gram silicone. ",sep="")

```

```{r print_OTHER_DETECTION_LIMIT, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

WE DO THE MAS15 detect limit above... 
  IF MAS15 THEN
    The median value for detection limits across all compounds is approximately 200 ng/Wristband or 50ng/gram silicone. 

BUT NEED TO DO the other ones
IF PAH then:
  
IF Pesticide THEN:
  
If VOC THEN
  


```

```{r print_loreal_4c2,results="asis", echo=FALSE, eval =  FALSE}

cat("Additionally, since the wristbands can be of different sizes, ",
      "we normalize by size of wristband to create  the raw nanograms ",
      "found in each gram of wristband material in each wristband normalized ",
      "only to time-adjust the values as though the wristband were worn for exactly one week.  ",
      sep=" ")

```

```{r print_loreal_4b2, results="asis", echo=FALSE, eval=wristbands_time_adjusted_one_day}

cat("More exactly, it is the raw nanograms found  in each wristband normalized ",
      "to time-adjust the values as though the wristband were worn for exactly one DAY. ",
      "In other words, if a wristband was worn for 2.5 days, we divided the total " ,
      "nanograms by 2.5 to result in the per day number.  Similarly if the wristband ",
      "was worn for 5 days, we divided the total nanograms by 5 to result in the per day number. ",
      "The median value for detection limits across all  compuonds is ",
      "approximately 200 ng/Wristband or 50ng/gram.",
      sep="") 

```

Therefore, these data give you a more direct sense of "how much" of a given chemical was found. Having said that, since chemicals enter the wristband at different rates, it is incorrect to try to deduce relative exposures between compounds. Numerical data should be compared amongst participants for one compound at-a-time. Numbers also have variability depending on the specific compound and analytical performance. Having provided that disclaimer, however, we're still showing the scientifically accurate "how much we found" information below which is in nanograms. Compounds not found and/or below the limit-of-detection are shown as zero values.

```{r print_skip_printing_matrix_messageB, results="asis" , echo=FALSE, eval =  (!allow_matrix_to_print)}

cat("**Please see separately provided files for large matrix data sets which would normally be displayed here.  Since your project had a large results table, it is easier to view on its own rather than in this file** ",sep="")

```

```{r  pandoc_X_NOT_normalized, results='asis', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=allow_matrix_to_print}

# NEED TO SORT X2 so it matches the chart above

### Grab the rows from testResults I need to print this data matrix
#     rename them for better reading and print matris of all raw values for all chems /WB's
#     use replace_na to Get rid of all the NA values and replace with quartile of ZERO

### 2/21/2019  COMMENT OUT version with FILTER and replace with version with NO FILTER of zero vales
# raw_data<-testResults.big %>%
#   filter(Result>0)%>%
#   select(ParameterName,SampleNumber,Result) %>%
#   spread(SampleNumber,Result) %>%
#   replace(is.na(.), 0) %>%    
#   arrange(ParameterName) %>%
#   rename('Chemical Name'=ParameterName) %>%
#   as.data.frame()

#ATTEMPTING to eliminate ZERO values from testResults.big with a filter
tr.big.without.NotFound <- testResults.big %>% filter(PureSampleName!="not_found")

### 2/21/2019  COMMENT OUT version with FILTER and replace with version with NO FILTER of zero vales
### 11/12/2021 BUT then i got rows with "not_found" so I then filter THAT out which may recreate OTHER problem but....
raw_data<-tr.big.without.NotFound %>%
  select(ParameterName,SampleNumber,Result) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  spread(SampleNumber,Result) %>%
  replace(is.na(.), 0) %>%    
  arrange(ParameterName) %>%
  dplyr::rename('Chemical Name'=ParameterName) %>%
  as.data.frame()

pandoc.table(raw_data,
             caption="Full List of Chemicals"  ,
