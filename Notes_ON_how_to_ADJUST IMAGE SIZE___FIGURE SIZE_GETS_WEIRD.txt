SEE BOOK that explains everything about RMarkdown for better info on
figure_wideth and height and also OUTPUT_width and height and DPI
I think between all that it is clear(er)

NOTES On bug of printing via automated script compressing all images

IN HEADER of RMD
	  html_document:
	    fig_height: 7
    	    fig_width: 6.5
    	    

in Heat Map code in RMD:
	fig.height=8

{r x5_activeChemChart, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=8,fig.cap=""}

THIS was in the OLD section but not in the new section:
options(height = 8)  #this is redundant with the heading setting I THINK but so what

in OUTPUT:
label: setup_heatmap_chart (with options) 
List of 4
 $ echo      : logi FALSE
 $ message   : logi FALSE
 $ fig.height: num 8
 $ fig.cap   : chr ""

CURRENT THINKING
	out.width = '40%' might work??
	SOOOO it is NOTHING to with Pandoc or pander
	it is all KNIT which writes out the file as PNG
	we COULD change things in readking in the file in PANDER which processes the MD file 
	but
	that won't work cause knit is writing too small
	
SOOOOO:
What WORKED for the heat map:
	Testing knit-to-html menu
	tested PRINT to html
	not tested: print to DOCX
		in DOCX it is terrible

ANOTHER idea is writing to JPG file...

ANOTHER idea is to set the DPI to 150
	Testing knit-to-html menu -- good
	tested PRINT to html  TOO BIG
	
another idea... NOTHIGN on parameters
	Testing knit-to-html menu -- good
		
	Testing knit-to-word menu -- good
		testing PRINT to DOCx --> ERROR on converstion-failure

fig.height=6,dpi=150:  (but if I change dpi to 300 it does NOT work well (too big in print-to-html)
	knit menu to html: good
	knit menu to docx: good
	knit menu to PDF: FAILURE (maybe failed before, do not know root cause)
	print all to html:  GOOD
	print all to docx  GOOD
	print all to pdf:  Not ever done...

TRY DPI=300 to see what happens...

````{r img-setup, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
