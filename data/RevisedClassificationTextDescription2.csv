Classification,Description,Sources,Examples,Strategies
Consumer & Personal Care Products,"Chemicals found in household goods, consumable items, and personal care products, including food, beverages, cosmetics, and cleaning supplies. These may serve as preservatives, fragrances, or active ingredients.","Exposure occurs through direct contact with products, such as cosmetics, cleaning agents, or food. This can include inhalation of sprays, ingestion of residues, or skin absorption during use of everyday items.","Examples include galaxolide in perfumes, caffeine in beverages, lilial in lotions, and parabens in cosmetics. Exposure happens via dermal contact (cosmetics), ingestion (food/beverages), or inhalation (cleaning sprays).","Reduce exposure by using fragrance-free or natural alternatives, selecting products with fewer preservatives, or choosing eco-certified goods (ex: EPA Safer Choice or Nordic Swan). Limit the use of heavily processed items and ensure proper ventilation during household product use."
Industrial & Commercial Chemicals,"Chemicals used in manufacturing, construction, and commercial products including building materials. This category includes volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other chemicals found in paints, adhesives, solvents.","VOCs can be released into the air from solvents, adhesives, paints, and many commercial materials. Other industrial processes also expose workers to a range of hazardous chemicals during manufacturing or to consumers through handling of products. ","Compounds can be found in building materials or glues, benzene in industrial solvents, and phthalates in packaging materials are common exposures. Inhalation of VOCs from paint fumes, adhesives, or cleaning agents is typical.","Opt for low-VOC or VOC-free products, ensure proper ventilation in work and home environments, and use personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling chemicals. Choose alternatives to harmful solvents and limit exposure (physically or through respirators as appropriate) to freshly painted or renovated areas."
Agricultural & Pharmaceutical Chemicals,"Chemicals used in agriculture (pesticides, herbicides, fungicides) and pharmacology (active ingredients in medications). These chemicals are designed to affect biological systems.","Exposure occurs through ingestion of pesticide residues in food, inhalation of pesticide sprays, or contact with pharmaceutical compounds during production or use. Workers handling pesticides or drugs are at higher risk of exposure.","Examples include glyphosate in herbicides, ibuprofen in medications, and rodenticides in pest control products. Agricultural workers and healthcare workers are particularly exposed through dermal contact or inhalation of chemical agents.","Mitigation strategies can include choosing organic produce to avoid pesticide residues, using safer alternative pest control methods or at least following the pesticide labels, ensuring proper ventilation, wearing PPE during application of pesticides, and following drug safety protocols during medication production and use."
Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs),"Long-lasting, environmentally persistent chemicals that accumulate in living organisms and thay may biomagnify in food webs. These include dioxins, furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which are often byproducts of industrial processes or combustion.","Exposure can occur through contaminated food, air, or water near industrial sites, incineration facilities, or areas where PCB-containing equipment was improperly disposed of or used. ",Examples include consuming fish or dairy products contaminated with PCBs or inhaling air near industrial sites where dioxins are released from combustion processes. Workers or building inhabitants handling old electrical equipment may also encounter PCBs.,"Mitigate exposure by supporting proper waste management practices, avoiding consumption of contaminated animal fats, and ensuring safe disposal of PCB-containing materials. Promote industrial practices that minimize emissions of dioxins and furans."
Flame Retardants,"Chemicals that are added to products to reduce fire hazards. These include polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs).","Exposure occurs through dust in homes, workplaces, or vehicles where flame-retardant-treated products are used, such as electronics, furniture, and building materials. Flame retardants can leach from these products over time.",Specific exposures include inhalation of dust from furniture treated with PBDEs or skin contact with flame-retardant-treated clothing or electronics. Dust in homes with flame-retardant materials is a common source.,"Choose flame-retardant-free products when possible, use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to reduce household dust, and regularly wash hands, especially after handling electronics or furniture. Opt for eco-friendly alternatives when purchasing furniture or textiles."
"Pollutants from burning fuels, soot, smoke","PAHs are chemical compounds released during the incomplete combustion of organic materials. They are commonly associated with fossil fuel use and industrial emissions, as well as in food preparation methods like grilling.","Sources of exposure include vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, cigarette smoke, and grilled or smoked foods. PAHs are also found in contaminated soil near industrial sites or areas with heavy traffic.","Specific examples include inhalation of PAHs from air pollution (vehicle exhaust, industrial plants) or fires, while ingestion of PAHs can come from grilled meats or smoked foods. Dermal contact may occur through contact with contaminated soil/surfaces/products.","Reduce PAH exposure by avoiding or minimizing consumption of grilled or smoked foods, promoting the use of clean energy and low-emission vehicles, and avoiding areas with heavy industrial or vehicular pollution. Ensure proper ventilation in high-exposure environments."
