## Compound Classification

Our `r testName` process tests for **`r howManyChemicalsTested`** chemicals. We have classified these chemicals into a few categories to make these results easier to understand.

Every chemical in the testing is classified into one **or more** of the following categories:

| Classification                          | Classification Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|

| Pharmacological                         | Used in making or as components of manufactured drugs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)       | VOCs are a large chemical classification made up of alkanes, benzenes, and other volatile (i.e.Â easily airborne) compounds that are found in burning fuels and released from many consumer products like solvents, paints, adhesives, preservatives, cleaners and building materials. |

#THIS USED TO PRINT THE MATRIX in Kludgy way.  Then i cut/pasted from the OUTPUT of the below and then moved this into VISUAL mode temporarily which made editing it much easier
