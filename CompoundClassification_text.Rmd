## Sources & Strategies {#class_link_id} 

We tested for **`r howManyChemicalsTested`** chemicals and grouped them into categories to make the results easier to understand.


<!-- Our r testName  tests for **r howManyChemicalsTested** chemicals. 
We have classified these chemicals into a few categories to make these results easier to understand.
-->

Every chemical in the testing is classified into one **or more** of the following categories and here we provide a general description of this group of chemicals and some general strategies to reduce exposure:


```{r classInfoLoadPrep, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}


# Convert to gt table

# Select the columns i want for output
classExplainTableOutput <- classExplainTable %>%
  select(`Chemical Group`, `Description`, `Sources`, `Examples`, `Strategies`)
# Output with gt()
classExplainTableOutput %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = md("**Classification Explanation Table**")) %>%
  cols_align(align = "right", columns = 1) %>%  # First column right-aligned
  cols_align(align = "left", columns = 2:ncol(classExplainTableOutput))   # Other columns left-aligned


```
