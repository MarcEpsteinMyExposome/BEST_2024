## Chemical Group Sources & Strategies {#class_link_id}

We tested for **`r howManyChemicalsTested`** chemicals and grouped them into categories to make the results easier to understand.


<!-- Our `r testName`  tests for **`r howManyChemicalsTested`** chemicals. 
We have classified these chemicals into a few categories to make these results easier to understand.
-->

Every chemical in the testing is classified into one **or more** of the following categories and here we provide a general description of this group of chemicals and some general strategies to reduce exposure:


```{r classInfoLoadPrep, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}



# 
# classExplainTable <- read.table(class_explain_table_name,  sep = ",",  header = TRUE   ) %>%
#   dplyr::rename("Chemical Group"=Classification)
# 
# pandoc.table(classExplainTable,
#              justify=c("right","left","left","left","left"),  #ADD "left" as needed for number of "ncol" above
#              emphasis.co.names=TRUE,
#              caption=""
#              ,split.table = Inf
#              ,split.cells=70
#              #,style = 'grid'
#              #,style = 'rmarkdown'
#              )

# Read CSV instead of read.table (better for modern workflows)
classExplainTable <- read_csv(class_explain_table_name) %>%
  rename(`Chemical Group` = Classification)  # 

# Convert to gt table
classExplainTable %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = md("**Classification Explanation Table**")) %>%
  cols_align(align = "right", columns = 1) %>%  # First column right-aligned
  cols_align(align = "left", columns = 2:ncol(classExplainTable))   # Other columns left-aligned
  #opt_table_overflow(scroll_x = TRUE)  # Enable horizontal scrolling for long text
