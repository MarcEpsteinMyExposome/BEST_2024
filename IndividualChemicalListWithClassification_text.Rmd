## Chemical Groups  {.tabset}

The following chemicals were found on your wristband.  We show how each chemical is grouped. We have listed the chemicals both individually, showing their chemical group, and by group, showing all the chemicals with each group.

### Each Chemical Found, With its Group

```{r  ListChemFound, results='asis', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Pull out the results for our ONE SUBJECT
###  We doing as INNER cause we REQUIRE all internal data MUST map every tested chem to a classification


#Convert classificaiton col to character
# Do SQL call without doing SQL using native stuff
oneResultClassified<-inner_join(oneResult_with_Y_flag,class_L, by="ParameterID") %>% 
  select(ParameterName,CASNumber,classification) %>%
  group_by(ParameterName,CASNumber) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(Classifications=paste(classification,collapse=", ")) %>%
  arrange(ParameterName) 



names(oneResultClassified)<-c("Chemical Name", "Chemical ID Number","Chemical Group(s)")


#THIS REPORT got TOO WIDE so was made to fit onto multiple pages and so the basic table point was LOST
# NOTE that "split.table= Inf" is the thing that makes this NEVER PAGE WRAP and so is good for HTML but not so good for WORD
pandoc.table(as.data.frame(oneResultClassified)
             ,caption="Grouping Report on your Wristband"
             ,justify=c("left","left","center")
             ,emphasis.rownames=TRUE #RowNames never get emphasis... SHOULD switch to gt() someday
             ,split.table = Inf
             )
rm(oneResultClassified)
