### At Least One of a Classification

A related question is how many study participants had at least one of any given classification (e.g. how many participants had at least one "Flame Retardant").



```{r atLeastOneEachClassification , results='asis', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE }

#
# NOTE:  I took away ONE from "ncol(cs)" when converting from SQLdf to dplyr/tidyr NOT SURE WHY
#   cause this seems to work perfectly...maybe previous extra col was duplicated classifications?

# pandoc.table(SubClassAtleastOne,
#              split.cells=20,  #30 the default
#              justify=c("left","right","right"),  #
#              caption = "Tested Wristbands with **at least one** of a given classification"
#             # ,split.tables=110  #80 the default
#             ,split.table = Inf
# )


 SubClassAtleastOne %>%
   gt() %>%
   tab_header(
     title = md("**Tested Wristbands with at least one of a given classification**")
     )  %>%
   cols_align(
    align = "left",
    columns = 1
  ) %>%
  cols_align(
    align = "right",
    columns = 2:3 # Adjust for actual number of columns
  ) %>%
  tab_style(
    style = cell_text(weight = "bold", size = px(12)),
    locations = cells_column_labels(everything())
  )




```
