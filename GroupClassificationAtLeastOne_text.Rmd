### At Least One of a Classification

A related question is how many study participants had at least one of any given classification (e.g. how many participants had at least one "Flame Retardant").



```{r atLeastOneEachClassification , results='asis', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE }

#
# NOTE:  I took away ONE from "ncol(cs)" when converting from SQLdf to dplyr/tidyr NOT SURE WHY
#   cause this seems to work perfectly...maybe previous extra col was duplicated classifications?

pandoc.table(SubClassAtleastOne,
             split.cells=20,  #30 the default
             justify=c("left","right","right"),  #
             caption = "Tested Wristbands with **at least one** of a given classification"
            # ,split.tables=110  #80 the default
            ,split.table = Inf
)


```
