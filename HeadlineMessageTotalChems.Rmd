<!-- PRINT Headline Rule as denoted by Silent Spring using a separate RMD file-->

<!--  Headlines for amount detected (by chemical group)     HAVE NOTE IMPLEMENTED THIS YET... is listed in the Silent Spring FEEDBACK
We propose applying these headlines to each chemical group separately. The participant would receive the top priority headline that applies for each chemical group. The headlines are not exhaustive (i.e., not all participants will necessarily receive a headline for every group). The headlines are intended to highlight particularly high or low.

The total number of chemicals found in your wristband was **`r howManyChemicalsFoundThisWristband`**. The average number of chemicals found across all tested wristbands in this project was **`r round(averageNumberChemsFound,1) `**.  The maximum number of chemicals found on any one wristband was **`r maxChemFoundOnAnyOneWristband`**.  The minimum number of chemicals found on any one wristband was **`r minChemFoundOnAnyOneWristband`**.   

The total number of distinct chemicals found across all the wristbands in this study was **`r howManyUniqueChemFoundAcrossAllWristbands`**.
