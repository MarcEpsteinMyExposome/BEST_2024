### Chemicals on ANY Wristband

The following list of chemicals were found on at least one of the wristbands in this study.


```{r  ListChemFoundAcrossAll, results='asis', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Pull out the results for our ONE SUBJECT
###  We doing as INNER cause we REQUIRE all internal data MUST map every tested chem to a classification
testResultsWithClass<- left_join(testResults.big, class_L,by="ParameterID",relationship = "many-to-many") %>%
  filter(Result>0)


#Convert classificaiton col to character
# Do SQL call without doing SQL using native stuff
AllResultClassified<-testResultsWithClass %>% 
  select(ParameterName,CASNumber,classification) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(ParameterName,CASNumber) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(Classifications=paste(classification,collapse=", ")) %>%
  arrange(ParameterName)%>%
  select(ParameterName,CASNumber)  # THIS IS SILLY CODE cause we classify, then delete data but done for uniform approach



names(AllResultClassified)<-c("Chemical Name", "CAS Number")


#THIS REPORT got TOO WIDE so was made to fit onto multiple pages and so the basic table point was LOST
# NOTE that "split.table= Inf" is the thing that makes this NEVER PAGE WRAP and so is good for HTML but not so good for WORD
# pandoc.table(as.data.frame(AllResultClassified)
#              ,caption="All Chemicals found Across all WB in Study"
#              ,justify=c("left","left")
#              ,emphasis.rownames=TRUE #RowNames never get emphasis... SHOULD switch to gt() someday
#              ,split.table = Inf
#              )

AllResultClassified %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = md("**All Chemicals Found Across All WB in Study**")) %>%
  cols_align(align = "left", columns = everything()) %>%  # Left-align all columns
  tab_options(table.width = px(800))  # Adjust width for readability

rm(AllResultClassified)
